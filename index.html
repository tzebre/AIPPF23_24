        <h3>Abstract</h3>
        <p>Facial recognition technology is rapidly advancing globally, finding applications ranging from unlocking
            smartphones to identifying individuals in public spaces. However, integrating this technology into our daily
            lives requires careful consideration of both technical and ethical aspects. We need to ensure that it aligns
            effectively with the contemporary world. In order to demonstrate the feasibility of implementing facial
            recognition systems and highlight their efficiency in face identification, we propose the implementation of
            an algorithm that utilizes a webcam to capture 2D facial images for recognition purposes. This endeavor aims
            to showcase that the implementation of such technology is not overly complex and can facilitate swift facial
            identification.</p>

                    <p>Started in the early 60’s in secret by Woodrow “Woody” Bledsoe in the Central Intelligence
                        Agency (CIA), research
                        about facial recognition has quickly evolved and found important usage in our daily lives.</p>
                    <p> In the early daysfacial recognition didn’t even use computing methods, it was only an assembly
                        of manual
                        measurements between different facial points. This identification technique evolved in parallel
                        with
                        Artificial
                        intelligence and deep learning improvement, leading to quicker and better identification relying
                        on more
                        features.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Today, thanks to improved hardware, facial recognition can be used on a wide range of hardware
                        such as
                        computers,
                        drones, or cameras. It uses a wide range of technologies such as Haar or thermal images to
                        extract features.
                        However, this emerging technology is increasingly raising ethical and security issues. </p>

                    <h6>Facial recognition in airport-Thales </h6>
                    <p>Thales is working on facial recognition technology for airport use. By utilizing smart gates and
                        biometric passports, it aims to expedite identity checks with advanced algorithms. However,
                        concerns arise regarding data storage, privacy, age-related changes, and cosmetic surgery. The
                        algorithm must consider unchangeable variables to ensure effectiveness and address these
                        concerns.

                    </p>
                    <h6>Face ID-Apple </h6>
                    <p>Apple has made significant progress in integrating facial recognition into our daily lives
                        through Face ID. This advanced technology combines hardware and software to enhance facial
                        recognition accuracy, with an error rate of one in a million. By utilizing various sensors,
                        including an IR camera, Apple creates a detailed 3D facial map and precise 2D mapping. In terms
                        of ethics and security, Apple ensures that all biometric data is stored only on the device
                        itself. Additionally, Apple has implemented an attention awareness feature that requires the
                        user to actively look at the phone to unlock it, reducing the risk of unauthorized access
                        through forced unlocking methods.

                    <h6>Mass monitoring-law enforcement authorities </h6>
                    <p>The proliferation of CCTV, facial recognition, and machine learning has increased surveillance
                    capabilities for law enforcement. While it aids security, concerns arise regarding privacy, bias,
                    and ethical implications. Some tech companies have restricted sales of facial recognition data
                    to address these concerns, but its effectiveness remains uncertain. The use of such technology
                    raises fundamental questions about its necessity and accuracy.
                    </p>

                    <h6>Recognitions systems on drone-US Army </h6>
                    <p>The US Army has partnered with RealNetworks to develop autonomous drones with facial recognition
                        capabilities for intelligence and surveillance missions. The technology aims to minimize risks
                        to human life and enhance operational efficiency. However, ethical concerns arise regarding the
                        potential future use of armed drones and their autonomous decision-making capabilities. The
                        question of whether a drone should have the authority to kill based on facial recognition
                        identification raises significant ethical considerations. The broader issue lies in the
                        potential consequences, both positive and negative, that could arise from the development and
                        deployment of facial recognition technology in military contexts.

                    <p>Upon initial observation, there are a huge number of facial recognition algorithms and methods.
                        They are all more or less complex, have different learning methods and retain data for varying
                        lengths of time. As part of this project for the GE2340 course, we chose to show how to
                        implement a facial recognition algorithm on your computer. For our approach, we selected the
                        Viola-Jones Face Detection Technique, also known as Haar Cascade, for two reasons: first, it's
                        an extremely efficient algorithm and, second, it fully meets the ethical concerns we had in
                        mind. </p>
