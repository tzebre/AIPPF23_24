        <h3>Abstract</h3>
        <p class="col-8 mx-auto">Facial recognition technology is rapidly advancing globally, finding applications
            ranging from unlocking
            smartphones to identifying individuals in public spaces. However, integrating this technology into our daily
            lives requires careful consideration of both technical and ethical aspects. We need to ensure that it aligns
            effectively with the contemporary world. In order to demonstrate the feasibility of implementing facial
            recognition systems and highlight their efficiency in face identification, we propose the implementation of
            an algorithm that utilizes a webcam to capture 2D facial images for recognition purposes. This endeavor aims
            to showcase that the implementation of such technology is not overly complex and can facilitate swift facial
            identification.</p>

                    <p>Started in the early 60’s in secret, research about facial recognition has quickly evolved and
                        found important usage in our daily lives.</p>
                    <p> In the early days facial recognition didn’t even use computing methods, it was only an assembly
                        of manual measurements between different facial points. This identification technique evolved in
                        parallel with Artificial intelligence and deep learning improvement, leading to quicker and
                        better identification relying on more features.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Today, thanks to improved hardware, facial recognition can be used on a wide range of hardware
                        such as computers, drones, or cameras. It uses a wide range of technologies such as Haar or
                        thermal images to extract features. However, this emerging technology is increasingly raising
                        ethical and security issues. </p>

                    <h6>Facial recognition in airport-Thales </h6>
                    <p>Thales is working on facial recognition technology for airport use. By utilizing smart gates and
                        biometric passports, it aims to expedite identity checks with advanced algorithms. However,
                        concerns arise regarding data storage, privacy, age-related changes, and cosmetic surgery. The
                        algorithm must consider unchangeable variables to ensure effectiveness and address these
                        concerns.
                    </p>
                    <h6>Face ID-Apple </h6>
                    <p>Apple has made significant progress in integrating facial recognition into our daily lives
                        through Face ID. This advanced technology combines hardware and software to enhance facial
                        recognition accuracy, with an error rate of one in a million. By utilizing various sensors,
                        including an IR camera, Apple creates a detailed 3D facial map and precise 2D mapping. In terms
                        of ethics and security, Apple ensures that all biometric data is stored only on the device
                        itself. Additionally, Apple has implemented an attention awareness feature that requires the
                        user to actively look at the phone to unlock it, reducing the risk of unauthorized access
                        through forced unlocking methods.

                    <h6>Mass monitoring-law enforcement authorities </h6>
                    <p>The proliferation of CCTV, facial recognition, and machine learning has increased surveillance
                        capabilities for law enforcement. While it aids security, concerns arise regarding privacy,
                        bias, and ethical implications. Some tech companies have restricted sales of facial recognition
                        data to address these concerns, but its effectiveness remains uncertain. The use of such
                        technology raises fundamental questions about its necessity and accuracy.
                    </p>

                    <h6>Recognitions systems on drone-US Army </h6>
                    <p>The US Army has partnered with RealNetworks to develop autonomous drones with facial recognition
                        capabilities for intelligence and surveillance missions. The technology aims to minimize risks
                        to human life and enhance operational efficiency. However, ethical concerns arise regarding the
                        potential future use of armed drones and their autonomous decision-making capabilities. The
                        question of whether a drone should have the authority to kill based on facial recognition
                        identification raises significant ethical considerations. The broader issue lies in the
                        potential consequences, both positive and negative, that could arise from the development and
                        deployment of facial recognition technology in military contexts.

                    <p>Upon initial observation, there are a huge number of facial recognition algorithms and methods.
                        They are all more or less complex, have different learning methods and retain data for varying
                        lengths of time. As part of this project for the GE2340 course, we chose to show how to
                        implement a facial recognition algorithm on your computer. For our approach, we selected the
                        Viola-Jones Face Detection Technique, also known as Haar Cascade, for two reasons: first, it's
                        an extremely efficient algorithm and, second, it fully meets the ethical concerns we had in
                        mind. </p>
                    <h6>Problem 1-Technical part </h6>
                    <p>let's talk about the Haar Cascades facial recognition method. This method uses machine learning,
                        and its "cascade" function is trained on images that are positive as well as negative. This
                        algorithm is based on Haar feature, we can define simple ones: Edge
                        features, Line features, and Four-rectangle features (Image 1) are our three primary Haar
                        features that we use to do this. So, one of the first steps in our project was to code these
                        features.</p>
                    <img class="mx-auto d-block" src="img/feature.png" title="Image 1: Three main Haar features.">
                    <p>Subtracting the total of the pixels beneath the black and white portions from the total of the
                        pixels under the white portion yields a unique value.</p>
                    <p>We must first determine the amounts under the black and white squares in order to see the
                        difference. This is where the concept of "integral images" is introduced. Consequently, a
                        picture is created, with the sum of the pixels in the top left corner at each location. In
                        order, to get the sum of pixels from an area, we only need to access four value of the integral
                        image (Image 2). </p>

                         title="Image 2) Diagram showing the calculation of the set of pixels located to the top left of a point.">
                    <p>This is the second major challenge of our project, coding the concept of image integral and
                        generating the image of the pixel sum set.</p>
                    <img class="mx-auto d-block" src="img/integral.png"

                    <p>It frequently happens that the results of computations are not used because they are not useful.
                        However, our algorithm does not currently know which values to
                        retain; we do. Next, we present the concept of "Adaboost". In order to find the optimal
                        threshold for categorizing into positive (face present) and negative (no face) categories, we
                        must apply each feature to our training photos (face or not face). Only the features with the
                        lowest error rates
                        are chosen in an effort to minimize mistakes and misclassifications. These characteristics help
                        to distinguish a face. It's a more involved process. At the start, each image has the same
                        weight. Photos with bad classifications are given additional weight after each classification.
                        After then, the same process is repeated. Error rates are now calculated. Additionally, new
                        weight measurements are acquired. Until the desired accuracy or error rate is reached, or until
                        the necessary number of features is identified, the process is repeated. A weighted sum of the
                        weak classifiers creates the final classifier. The significant issue of efficiency now arises.
                        The idea of a "Cascade of Classifiers" has been presented. We will no longer use every feature
                        on a single window. Each characteristic will be categorized into a classifier stage, which will
                        be applied sequentially. This effectively says that we won't move on to the second step if the
                        first is not validated. When there is nothing to do with the person's face in the image window,
                        this saves a significant amount of time. But for this step system to function correctly, phase
                        one characteristics need to be laxer than phase two characteristics, and so forth. We've only
                        coded the function that retrieves feature values regardless of their location in an image.</p>

                    <p>But we didn't use it because we would have had to train the model with it. The same goes for
                        phase batch classification. However, we preferred to use models that had already been trained,
                        as the training data set selected by these teams is far more relevant than what we would have
                        selected with our limited experience. This would have created a bias due to our poor
                        selection.</p>
                    <h6>Problem 2-Ethical part </h6>
                    <p>We are a group made up of members all from Europe where there is in the RGPD in force. Having
                        been aware for several years of the need to protect our personal data and privacy, we decided to
                        focus on a subject such as facial recognition, and more specifically on Haar Cascades facial
                        recognition method.</p>
                    <p>From an ethical point of view, we have chosen to use this approach because we have total control
                        over our training image bank. Taking care to use only images of faces that are free of rights
                        and of consenting individuals is very important to us, as we want to respect everyone's privacy
                        as much as possible and ensure that their data is used only for the purposes we set out in our
                        initial objective. It's also important to know that the only time we store any information using
                        this technique is when we're forming our training dataset. Apart from this, we do not store any
                        personal information, nor do we make any link between a person's identity and their image. Nor
                        do we store images after a face has been identified, as this is part of the personal data used
                        to identify a person.</p>

                    <h6>Reproduction and use of Face recognition with Haar Cascades method</h6>
                    <p>We used a model provided by OpenCV, which specializes in face recognition. It is,
                        of course, based on Haar Cascades, and we used the parts of the code reworked by our group: haar
                        features, image integral and feature value retrieval. On the other hand, having selected a
                        model, and even though we hadn't trained it ourselves, we decided to test it to verify the
                        figures we'd read about in the Haar Cascades facial recognition method research paper. </p>
                    <p>We made one code base on OpenCV to place a rectangle around the face `webcam.py`.</p>
                    <p>To test the algorithm, we selected an image dataset comprising a thousand face images from celebA
                        face and a thousand images composed of furniture and animals. After running the method on the
                        2000 images (`folder.py`), we obtained forty-five false negatives, zero false positives and
                        eighteen double
                        positives (two faces found on an image, the correct face from the photo and a square that is not
                        a face). False negatives are considered serious because they are misleading, whereas double
                        positives are less serious because they identify the face in the photo.</p>

                    <h6>Trying to beat the Haar Cascades method</h6>
                    <p>To test the robustness of the solution, we carried out several different tests. The first test
                        consists in generating two thousand images of the same size as the photos. These images are
                        composed of random pixels.</p>

                    <p>In pairs, we merge a photo from the test dataset with a randomly generated photo. We then run the
                        method on this new batch of images.</p>

                            <img class="mx-auto d-block" src="img/r15img.png"

                    </ul>
                    <p>Blurring at 15 has so little impact on the results that it's negligible, and blurring at 30
                        changes the results, but the method is still able to identify the images. There are just more
                        situations in which it detects two faces instead of one.</p>
                    <p>Rotating an image really impacts the results, as the method scans horizontally and therefore
                        can't deal with faces that aren't straight.</p>

                    <p>Facial recognition is a very broad field of computer vision, with many different approaches
                        possible, both in terms of software and hardware, or both. Each of these methods has its
                        advantages and disadvantages, whether in terms of computational resources or training datasets,
                        or in ethical terms. For this project, we decided to re-implement and test a method based on
                        Haar Cascades. We were able to highlight the robustness of this method, despite its very simple
                        technical foundations based on sums and products, by using various optimization methods such as
                        integral images and Adaboost applied on a cascade of weak classifiers.</p>
