                    <p>Started in the early 60’s in secret by Woodrow “Woody” Bledsoe in the Central Intelligence
                        Agency (CIA), research
                        about facial recognition has quickly evolved and found important usage in our daily lives.</p>
                    <p> In the early daysfacial recognition didn’t even use computing methods, it was only an assembly
                        of manual
                        measurements between different facial points. This identification technique evolved in parallel
                        with
                        Artificial
                        intelligence and deep learning improvement, leading to quicker and better identification relying
                        on more
                        features.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Today, thanks to improved hardware, facial recognition can be used on a wide range of hardware
                        such as
                        computers,
                        drones, or cameras. It uses a wide range of technologies such as Haar or thermal images to
                        extract features.
                        However, this emerging technology is increasingly raising ethical and security issues. </p>

                    <h6>Facial recognition in airport-Thales </h6>
                    <p>Thales, one of France's largest companies, is working on the development of facial recognition
                        for use in airports. They would use smart gates to identify people via their faces, enabling
                        users to use their biometric passports for identity checks. This would enable faster checks
                        without any action on the part of the user, while at the same time providing a higher level of
                        reliability thanks to advanced recognition algorithms. However, this will not replace all human
                        actions overnight but will complement them to facilitate the role of customs officers. The live
                        photo taken during the identity check is stored on a server and then compared with the subject
                        before he or she boards the plane. But there are problems associated with this system. For
                        example, we don't know how long a photo is stored on a server, and if a person doesn't want
                        their photo stored on the company's servers, how do they board the plane? What's more, if the
                        storage server leaks, then an ill-intentioned person will be able to obtain all the information
                        linked to a person's identity, as well as what he or she looks like. What's more, after a
                        certain age, passports are kept for longer and longer by individuals without needing to be
                        renewed, so the algorithm needs to be able to make a link between a more recent 2D photo of the
                        person and their current 3D face, which will be transformed by age. The algorithm must be able
                        to identify these two people as being the same. This is also a concern for people undergoing
                        cosmetic surgery, as the results of the algorithm's calculations may differ. The algorithm must
                        be based on variables that cannot be changed by the subject, otherwise it becomes obsolete. </p>
                    <h6>Face ID-Apple </h6>
                    <p>Apple has made a big step in implementing facial recognition in our daily use with Face ID. This
                        cutting-edge technology is an example of a hardware and software combination to improve facial
                        recognition performance leading to one error out of one million. A combination of different
                        captors such as an IR camera, helps to create a 3D map of the face and a precise 2D mapping. On
                        the ethics and security aspect, apple ensure that all the biometrics data are only stocked on
                        the phone, also Apple has implemented an attention awareness feature that implies the user to
                        investigate the phone to unlock it and thus reduce the risk of forced unlocking by a tier.</p>
                    <h6>Mass monitoring-law enforcement authorities </h6>
                    <p>The extent of possible surveillance by law enforcement authorities has significantly increased
                        with the advent of CCTV and facial recognition technologies, as well as machine learning
                        algorithms. This is very beneficial to society since it encourages the maintenance of security
                        by making it simple to find those who are committing crimes. However, it also raises more and
                        more worries about how it may affect our personal information, privacy, and
                        communities—especially communities of color. From the federal to the municipal levels, numerous
                        government organizations rely on tools created by the private sector to access massive volumes
                        of data from social media, smartphones, and private cloud servers. There are verifiable
                        instances of commercial businesses offering facial recognition and data collecting services to
                        government authorities in the USA case, including Clearview AI, Vigilant Solutions, and ODIN
                        Intelligence. Due to ethical concerns, a number of significant tech companies, including Amazon,
                        Microsoft, and IBM, have pledged to either temporarily or permanently stop selling face
                        recognition technology to law enforcement. This, however, calls into doubt the efficacy of such
                        efforts, since other businesses might continue to provide these technologies to government
                        organizations. In addition, we must consider the ethical and privacy consequences, raising
                        issues with database bias, technological accuracy, and the fundamental question of whether to
                        employ face recognition technology at all, even as accuracy increases. </p>
                    <h6>Recognitions systems on drone-US Army </h6>
                    <p>The US Army has partnered with a company called RealNetworks to create autonomous drones equipped
                        with facial recognition systems. The aim of this approach is benevolent, as it can help
                        enormously in intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance missions. A drone can be sent out
                        to identify criminals in hostile areas and theaters of war, without having to risk human life
                        every time. Technologically speaking, this implies having to deploy and design a software and
                        hardware stack capable of fitting on a single drone, including its on-board computer,
                        communication systems and remote-control software to enable operation in communication
                        environments, allow remote human operators to obtain exploitable information and open the
                        possibility of real-time autonomous response on the part of the robot. However, this leads us to
                        a very big negative point. The contract between the army and the company talks of equipping
                        unarmed drones for the time being, but once the technology has been developed, there's nothing
                        to stop them developing it on armed drones capable of killing. This raises a very big ethical
                        question: should the drone be allowed to make the decision to kill its target if identification
                        is positive? Depending on the country and the different laws, the drone could take this decision
                        to take life on its own, while in other countries, human confirmation would be required before
                        taking any action. The problem here is not directly linked to facial recognition, but rather to
                        all the drifts that could result from it, both good and bad. </p>

                    <p>Upon initial observation, there are a huge number of facial recognition algorithms and methods.
                        They are all more or less complex, have different learning methods and retain data for varying
                        lengths of time. As part of this project for the GE2340 course, we chose to show how to
                        implement a facial recognition algorithm on your computer. For our approach, we selected the
                        Viola-Jones Face Detection Technique, also known as Haar Cascade, for two reasons: first, it's
                        an extremely efficient algorithm and, second, it fully meets the ethical concerns we had in
                        mind. </p>
